I conduct my research at the [Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language in Donostia](https://www.bcbl.eu/en), Basque Country, Spain. 

BCBL research aims to unravel the neurocognitive mechanisms involved in the acquisition, comprehension and production of language, with special emphasis on bilingualism and multilingualism. The BCBL studies processes involved in normal child language acquisition and second language learning in adults, as well as learning disorders, language disorders, language-related effects of aging and neurodegeneration and language use in different social contexts.
