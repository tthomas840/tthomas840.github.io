Hi there, thanks for visiting my wegpage! 

I am a Doctoral student in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, or BCBL, in Donostia-San Sebastian, Basque Country, Spain. 

Here you can find a little overview of what I am currently up to. Check out the other pages of this webisite for more detailed information, or take a look at my CV [here]({{ https://tthomas840.github.io}}/assets/cv.pdf)!

## Current projects: 

### 2019-ongoing: Does who you are talking to affect what you remember?

I use behavioral and electrophysiological techniques to explore how speaker characteristics affect cognitive processes in attention and memory. I am primarily interested in how increases in listening effort can affect information encoding and retention. I also use EEG to study how the brain treats accent information  at different levels of discourse processing. 

### 2021-ongoing: Converse to Learn

This project, headed by Dr. Mark Warschauer and Dr. Ying Xu of the Digital Learning Lab at University of California, Irvine and partnered with PBS kids, investigates the use of conversational agents to support childrenâ€™s learning during interactive educational television consumption. As a visiting scholar I am assisting with data collection at a SoCal elementary school and data analysis.
