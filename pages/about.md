I am a Cognitive Neuroscience Ph.D. student in the Speech and Bilingualism research group at the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL) and a visiting scholar at the University of California, Irvine. I use behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) techniques to study how things like accent affect information processing and memory. 


My research (project title: Does who you are speaking to affect what you remember?) focuses on how interlocutor identity, especially deviations from standard speaker characteristics (accent, synthetic voice, virtual agent), affects attention and memory. I am especially interested in the relationship between listening effort and information retention during speech processing and exploring electroencephalographic data to elucidate processing mechanisms in non-native speech processing. 

Currently, I am a visiting scholar at the University of California Irvine, where I am working on the [Converse to Learn](https://www.conversetolearn.org) project. 

I am passionate about scientific dissemination and making science accessible! Check out my ‘off the clock’ page for more information about my involvement in community activities and glimpses of some of my other hobbies.
