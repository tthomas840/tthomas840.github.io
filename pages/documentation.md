## 2019-ongoing: **Does who you are talking to affect what you remember?**

I use behavioral and electrophysiological techniques to explore how speaker characteristics affect cognitive processes in attention and memory. I am primarily interested in how increases in listening effort can affect information encoding and retention. I also use EEG to study how the brain treats accent information  at different levels of discourse processing. 

## 2021-ongoing: **Converse to Learn**

This project, headed by Dr. Mark Warschauer and Dr. Ying Xu of the Digital Learning Lab at University of California, Irvine and partnered with PBS kids, investigates the use of conversational agents to support children’s learning during interactive educational television consumption. As a visiting scholar I am assisting with data collection at a SoCal elementary school and data analysis.

## 2016-2017: **Age-related changes in cognitive and sensory processing**

As a full-time Research Associate on a collaborative project between the Department of Psychological Sciences and the Speech and Hearing Sciences Department at Indiana University Bloomington, I administered cognitive batteries, auditory and visual tests to an elderly population of approximately 200 participants, collecting and analyzing longitudinal data to investigate links between sensory processing and cognition in aging adults.

## 2014-2017: **Phonotactic repairs in L2 learners of English**

For my undergraduate honors thesis, I programmed a Lexical Decision Task to study the lexical encoding of perceptual epenthetic vowels in English as a second language learners by examining whether the sound sequences permitted in one's L1 influence the way L2 words are represented in the mental lexicon. Check out our findings here!

## 2013-2017: **Visual perception and chronic cannabis use**

As an undergraduate research assistant in Dr. Tom Busey’s Visual Perception and Electrophysiological Lab at Indiana University Bloomington, I collected EEG and eye tracking data from cannabis users as part of a multi-lab study to better understand the effects of long term cannabis use on perceptual,structural and cognitive processes.
