## Science is for everyone! 

While there is no denying the importance of social media as a tool for scientific dissemination, in our often oversaturated society, I like to focus on local, or micro-community engagement. 

Below you can find some of the activities in my community that I am passionate about. 


## Brain Awareness Week

Brain Awareness Week is a global initiative to foster public enthusiasm for brain science. In Donostia, a special focus is placed on sparking the interest of young learners in neuroscience. Brain Awareness Week Donostia, or [Semana del Cerebro](https://www.eurekamuseoa.eus/es/semana-del-cerebro), is a collaboration between local elementary schools, the local science museum, and the BCBL. Once a year we create a program of fun, informative activities about the function, structure, and cognitive processes of the brain. Have a look last spring's program (in Spanish) [here](https://www.bcbl.eu/es/eventos-pasados/baw-2021)! 


## Pint of Science

Pint of Science is another global initiative that gives scientists and the public the opportunity to come together over beer and science. Come listen to Scientists present their research at local bars, admission is free and dicussion is encouraged. BCBL partners with several local pubs in Donostia. I was scheduled to give a talk on accent processing at the 2020 edition. Unfortunately our 2020 edition was cancelled due to the pandemic and a condensed [online](https://pintofscience.es/events/sansebastian) edition was created for 2021. Stay tuned for updates about whether my talk will be a part of the 2022 edition and check out my talk abstract below.

Beer or Bear? Processing Foreign Accents

In todayâ€™s globalized society, we are constantly communicating with people who are not speaking their first language. How do we communicate so effectively with people who are not native speakers of our language? Does accent affect our perception of the person talking? And can our expectations about a speaker even influence our perception? This talk will explore how accent affects our ability to communicate, as well as how we process information heard in foreign-accented speech. Inform yourself about how you understand and are understood in a multi-lingual world.

## la Red de Acogida Ciudadana de Donostia

As a foreigner myself in Spain, I am in a unique position to understand some of the difficulties immigrants face when trying to integrate into a new country. This organization works with refugees, immigrants, and other in-need and at-risk persons in Donostia. My work with them consists of helping immigrants transition into life in the Basque Country. I also assist with occational 'English for Business' workshops.
